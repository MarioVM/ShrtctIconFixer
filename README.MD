# IconFXR

IconFXR is a Python script designed to check and fix broken icon paths in Windows shortcut files (.lnk) within the current directory. The script attempts to resolve broken icon paths by changing the drive letter to `W:` and, if still broken, to `F:`.

## Features

- Checks icon paths of all shortcut files in the current directory.
- Attempts to fix broken icon paths by changing the drive letter.
- Logs all actions and outcomes to a log file (`iconfxr.log`).
- Displays a progress bar for the processing of shortcut files.

## Requirements

- Windows 11
- Python 3.x
- `pywin32` package
- `tqdm` package

## Installation

1. **Install Python 3.x**:
   Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install required packages**:
   Open a command prompt and run the following commands:
   ```bash

Run the script:
Open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you saved iconfxr.py. Run the script using Python:

python iconfxr.py

The script will process all .lnk files in the current directory, attempting to fix broken icon paths and logging the results.
